# Hi there, I'm Allen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who's passionate about **tech** and **software development**. I love diving into spontaneous projects, bringing random ideas to life just because they sound fun! Whether it's building Discord bots or tinkering with web development, I'm always up for solving challenges that pop into my head.

- I'm currently working on **[Chronobear](https://allen1821.github.io/chronobear/index.html)**â€”a website and Discord bot combo that's growing into something awesome maybe(;-;) !
- I'm learning more about **Python**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **C++**, because why not?
- Ask me about **Discord bots**, or literally anything tech-related. 
- Fun fact: I love making random things that just works.
